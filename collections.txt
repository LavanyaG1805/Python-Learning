Difference Between List and Tuple:
Lists are mutable: This means their elements can be modified (added, removed, or changed) after the list has been created.
Tuples are immutable: Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed. 
If modification is required, a new tuple must be created.
